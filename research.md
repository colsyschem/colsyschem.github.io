Our research interests are related to the bottom-up nanofabrication of new emerging materials using nanoparticle as building blocks and their use in plasmonic catalysis, biosensing, and nueroscience.

        <p><b>Nanoparticles Synthesis.</b> The shape variety of the nanocrystal defines their optical properties over a broad spectral range. The symmetry breaking, the emergence of crystal defects as well as surface heterogeneity are some of the aspects that bring our attention in studying the nanocrystals growth in the liquid phase. We look towards sustainable approaches and automatised processes to control the particles shape, size with progressively improving nanocrystals quality. </p>

        <p><b>Self-assembly.</b> Spatial distribution of nanoparticles in the liquid phase becomes a leading strategy for the bottom-up fabrication of either device-focused large-scale static assemblies or stimuli-responsive dynamic nanosystems. We focus on the system design to control inter-particle forces, the length-scale of the assemblies, and overall optical properties to build sustainable architectures operating at non-equilibrium conditions.</p>

        <p><b>Photochemistry.</b> By mimicking chemical processes typical in natural photosynthesis, we focus on using self-assembled nanoparticles of well-defined optical properties for light-driven regeneration of biological molecules - cofactors. We put attention on the architecture of the nanoscale building blocks and the control over the energy flow under light conditions that are crucial in improving the efficiency of the photochemical processes.</p>

        <p><b>Biosensing.</b> Colloidal biosensors based on metallic nanoparticles allow for rapid detection of biomolecules in physiological media at ultra-low concentrations. Within the collaboration with industrial partners, we focus on improving the optical signal transduction through the selective assembly of nanoparticles in the presence of DNA molecules. Colorimetric detection of the mutations in genetic material offers new solutions for liquid biopsy.</p>
