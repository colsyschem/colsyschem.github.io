<p>The Colloidal Systems Chemistry group, led by Marek Grzelczak, started research activities at Donostia International Physics Center in September 2020. In March 2020, the group moved to the Centro de Fisica de Materiales, which belongs to The Spanish National Research Council and University of Basque Country. We are an experimental group interested in studying materials and systems processes using colloids and nanoparticles as building blocks. The synthesis and dynamic self-assembly of nanocrystals are the primary research activities that couple directly to the application-driven work, aiming at both the bottom-up fabrication of photo-active systems in the context of artificial photosynthesis, and colorimetric sensing for liquid biopsy and detection of infectious diseases. The control over the nanomaterials synthesis and their organization, as well as photocatalytic activities and response to external stimuli, are four pillars of systems chemistry approached from the context of inorganic materials.</p>
