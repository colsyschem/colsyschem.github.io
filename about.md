<p>The Colloidal Systems Chemistry group, led by Marek Grzelczak, started research activities at Donostia International Physics Center, Donostia - San Sebastian, in September 2017. In March 2020, the group moved to an adjacent research institute - Centro de Fisica de Materiales. Currently, we focus on developing colloidal nanosystems with novel optical and physical properties. In particular, we are interested in synthesizing plasmonic nanocrystals and their use in the development of stimuli-responsive constructs of relevance in wide-range applications, including plasmonic catalysis, colorimetric biosensing, and neuronal photo-modulation.</p>
